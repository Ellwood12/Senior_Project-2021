title: "The Twin Problem"
description: |
  When given the chance to guess the gender of a child, is it
  as easy at fifty-fifty, or is there some deeper probability at hand?  In this problem, we explore the probability of guessing the gender of a twin when we are told the gender of one.

# **Background**

It is a beautiful afternoon and you are on your normal walk around the park.  After some time of walking, you decide to sit down and catch a breather.  While on a bench, you start up a conversation with a very nice lady who says she has come to the park with her two twin children.  During the conversation a little boy comes over and calls the lady, "Mom".  As the little boy is talking to his mother, you begin to wonder if the other twin child is also a boy or a girl.  After a few moments of thought, you realize that this question has more to do with probability that with biology.  What is the probability that the other child is a girl or boy?
