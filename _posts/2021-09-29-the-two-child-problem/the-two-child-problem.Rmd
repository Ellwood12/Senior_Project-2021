title: "The Twin Problem"
description: |
  When given the chance to guess the gender of a child, is it
  as easy at fifty-fifty, or is there some deeper probability at hand?  In this problem, we explore the probability of guessing the gender of a twin when we are told the gender of one.

# **Background**

It is a beautiful afternoon and you are on your normal walk around the park.  After some time of walking, you decide to sit down and catch a breather.  While on a bench, you start up a conversation with a very nice lady who says she has come to the park with her two twin children.  During the conversation a little boy comes over and calls the lady, "Mom".  As the little boy is talking to his mother, you begin to wonder if the other twin child is also a boy or a girl.  After a few moments of thought, you realize that this question has more to do with probability that with biology.  What is the probability that the other child is a girl or boy?   

# **Probability Explained**

Most people know that there is a fifty-fifty chance of getting tails when flipping coin.  This can be written out as:

$$
\text{------------------------------------------------}
\\\text{Prob(tails) = 1/2} \\\text{------------------------------------------------}
$$

And thanks to our knowledge of biology, this same statement applies.  The probability of have a boy or girl is 50%.  So why then isn't the answer to the 'Twin Problem' just 50% girl and 50% boy?  It is because of possible combinations, which we will go over now. 

If we were to draw out all the combinations of twins, it would look something like the image below.

In total, there are four possible combinations as drawn out in the image.  In each combination, there is a specific order that is important to note.  We will not use this plot to solve the question.
