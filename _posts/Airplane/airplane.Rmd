# **The Problem**
</center>

Today is a special day, you are taking a flight from your hometown to your dream vacation.  As you are about to board to plane, you find out that airline is going to have people board the plane one at a time according to when the bought their ticket.  You look down at your ticket and see that you are number 100 of 100 passengers.  Right before the first person enters the plane to be seated, you hear them tell a boarding agent that they can't remember what seat they purchased.  The boarding agent then whipsers to them that they can choose any open seat.  After hearing that conversation, you start to wonder if by the time you get on the plane, if your seat will be taken.  What is the probability that your seat will be taken?

# **Walk Through Example**

An good way to understand the answer to this question, will be to first, run through the possible solutions when fewer seats are offered. So, lets try when there are just three passengers.  The first, is the passenger that doens't know their seat, then a normal passenger, then you.  
For this example, we can use the image below, having the star seat represent your seat and the green dot as where the first passenger's seat is.

With this example, we will analyze 4 different outcomes.

First, as the first passenger enters the plane, there is a 33% chance, (1/3), that they sit in any seat.  If they were to sit in their seat and every passenger afterwards were to sit in their assigned seat, then there would be a 100% chance that you would sit your seat.

Second, lets say the first person doesn't pick your their seat and instead, picks yours.  That would be mean there is a 0% chance that you will sit in your seat.

For the third outcome, the first passenger is going to sit in the seat that isn't theirs or yours.

The next person to enter the plane is then given an option, to either sit in your chair, or the first passenger's chair.  This leaves a 50% chance that your seat will be open for when you get on the plane. For this outcome, we will say they choose the first passenger's seat, leaving your seat open.

For the last outcome, we will say that we the second passenger was given a chance between your seat and the first passenger's seat, they chose yours, meaning you were not able to sit in your seat.

To end this Walk-Through, lets look over the outcomes.

Outcome 1 | Outcome 2 | Outcome 3 | Outcome 4 
--|---|---|---
Yes | No | Yes | No

Now that we have an idea of what is happening in this story, we can dive into the explanation to see if your huntch is correct.
