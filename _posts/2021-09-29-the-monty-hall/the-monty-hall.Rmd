# **Background** 

The American TV show, "Let's Make A Deal", started in 1963 and was a global hit.  The premise of the game was that a contestant will be offered a prize and then a choice whether they would like to keep it, or exchange it for a different prize.  The challenge is that the other prize is hidden from the player.  So in the act of exchanging, the player doesn't know if they are getting a new prize of better or worse value.
