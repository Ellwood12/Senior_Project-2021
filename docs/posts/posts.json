The premise of the game was that a contestant will be offered a prize and then a choice whether they would like to keep it, or exchange it for a different prize. The challenge is that the other prize is hidden from the player. So in the act of exchanging, the player doesn’t know if they are getting a new prize of better or worse value.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
