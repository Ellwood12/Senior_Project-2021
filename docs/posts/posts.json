    "contents": "\nImage starts here\n\n\nThe Game\nThe American TV show, “Let’s Make A Deal”, started in 1963 and was a global hit. The premise of the game was that a contestant would be offered a prize and then given a choice whether they would like to keep it, or exchange it for a different prize. The challenge is that the other prize is hidden from the player. So in the act of exchanging, the player doesn’t know if they are getting a new prize of better or worse value.\nOn the show, there was a particular game that was played that has since then become famous and has been named the Monty Hall Problem. In this game, the contestant would be shown three doors, behind one of them, a glorious prize, behind the other two, goats. Through a serious of steps, the contestant would try and guess which door has the prize.\nBefore I share some statistical knowledge to them game, lets run through it as if we were contestants. Instead of playing behind three doors, we will play with playing cards that either have a goat or a queen. As in the image below, there are there are two possible outcomes, a goat or a queen.\n\nFace Down\n\n\n\n\nFace Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
