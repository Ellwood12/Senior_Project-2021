The US military had purposed purchasing Armour that could cover the plane’s vital pieces. They were hoping by doing so, that less planes would get shot down/damaged.\nSo, what they did, was they looked at bullet holes/damage on planes that had returned. An example being the image below.\n\n\n\nBased off the image above, what would you do? What steps would you take to help protect the planes and pilots?\nAnalysis\nBefore the military submitted their final decision, leader asked a group of mathematicians, (including famous mathematician Andrew Wald), to look over the project for any extra insights.\nThe solution that the mathematicians gave back was quite polar to what was previously presented. Their solution was: don’t armor the wings and tail. armor the engine. Now, if you weren’t to have looked at the image, protecting the engine seems like a no-brainer, but according to the image, there are a lot of red dots all over the wings and tail.\nThe researchers explained that all the images they were studying were of planes that were returning. None of the images explained what was happening to the planes that were not coming back. With this knowledge, it can be supposed that the planes that weren’t coming back were being hit in the areas where there were not red dots!\nThe insight and reasoning to this problem later produced what is known today as the Survivorship Bias. Survivorship bias describes the error of looking only at subjects who have reached a certain point without considering the subjects who haven’t.\nThanks to this insight, the military was able to better protect their planes and thus, save lives.\nFurther Application\nThe application of Survivorship Bias doesn’t end with World War II, it is still extremely applicable. To illustrate what this bias is trying to explain, I will use the following image.\n\n\n\nThe mistake that most commonly takes place is that the data (or people being surveyed) don’t represent the whole picture, but rather, a part that doesn’t interact well with the rest.\nSome great examples from off the web:\nBill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of college and became wildly successful. But for most college dropouts, it means unemployment and having more immediate student debt.\nMessi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Neymar are getting paid highly as football players. But the truth is, most players never make it into a game in their lifetime.\nMotivational gurus talk about following your passion and trusting your gut feelings — but there is no shortage of people who followed their passion and ended up seriously wrong.\n\n\n\nA survivorship bias that I found interesting was about Music and Art. Music from earlier periods is often thought of as better than music now. This could be because only the best music from the period is played now, while today’s music, good and bad, is far more available. So, survivorship of better songs creates the bias in perception.\nConclusion\nI hope you were able to enjoy this blog and learn something you can apply in your daily life. Understanding where your data came from and how it is going to be used can have vital consequences.\nIf you are interested in knowing more about the history of Survivorship Bias, I would recommend the TEDx below!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtUCxKsK4xg\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "There is a plane with 100 seats. The first person to get on the plane forgot their seat assignment and sat in a random spot.  If you are the 100th person to get on the plane, what is the probability that your seat hasn't been taken?",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\nThe Problem\n\nToday is a special day, you are taking a flight from your hometown to your dream vacation. As you are about to board to plane, you find out that airline is going to have people board the plane one at a time according to when the bought their ticket. You look down at your ticket and see that you are number 100 of 100 passengers. Right before the first person enters the plane to be seated, you hear them tell a boarding agent that they can’t remember what seat they purchased. The boarding agent then whispers to them that they can choose any open seat. After hearing that conversation, you start to wonder if by the time you get on the plane, if your seat will be taken. What is the probability that your seat will be taken?\n\nWalk Through Example\n\nA good way to understand the answer to this question, will be to first, run through the possible solutions when fewer seats are offered. So, lets try when there are just three passengers. The first, is the passenger that doesn’t know their seat, then a normal passenger, then you.\nFor this example, we can use the image below, having the star seat represent your seat and the green dot as where the first passenger’s seat is.\n\n\n\nWith this example, we will analyze 4 different outcomes.\nFirst, as the first passenger enters the plane, there is a 33% chance, (1/3), that they sit in any seat. If they were to sit in their seat and every passenger afterwards were to sit in their assigned seat, then there would be a 100% chance that you would sit your seat.\nSecond, let’s say the first person doesn’t pick your their seat and instead, picks yours. That would be mean there is a 0% chance that you will sit in your seat.\nFor the third outcome, the first passenger is going to sit in the seat that isn’t theirs or yours.\n\n\n\nThe next person to enter the plane is then given an option, to either sit in your chair, or the first passenger’s chair. This leaves a 50% chance that your seat will be open for when you get on the plane. For this outcome, we will say they choose the first passenger’s seat, leaving your seat open.\nFor the last outcome, we will say that we the second passenger was given a chance between your seat and the first passenger’s seat, they chose yours, meaning you were not able to sit in your seat.\n\n\n\nTo end this Walk-Through, let’s look over the outcomes. Here below is a table with the Outcome along with whether or not you got your seat.\nOutcome 1\nOutcome 2\nOutcome 3\nOutcome 4\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\nNow that we have an idea of what is happening in this story, we can dive into the explanation to see if your guess to the puzzle is correct.\nExplanation\nFor this explanation, I am going to refer to the three tables below. First thing to know about this puzzle is that the number “100”, isn’t needed to answer this question. In other words, it is a distraction, meant to make you think on a large scale when really, the answer can be solved form a smaller sample size.\nTable 1: 2 Passengers\nLet’s start with analyzing the results from Table 1. In this table, there are 2 possibilities: one “No”, and one “Yes”. This would mean, of the two possibilities, there is a (1/2) chance that you get your seat. So, let’s note, when there are 2 people, there is a 50% chance of getting your seat.\nFirst Passenger takes your seat\nFirst Passenger sits in their seat\na\nb\nNo\nYes\nTable 2: 3 Passengers\nFor Table 2 we are going to follow the same steps as in the paragraph before. Upon listing out all the possible outcomes and counting the “Yes/No”, we get the result two Yes’s and two No’s. This would mean we have a (2/4), or (1/2) chance of getting your seat. Now wait a minute, this is looking familiar, isn’t this the same result as with 2 passengers… Maybe the next Table will give us the final clue to solving this mystery.\nFirst Passenger Sits in their seat, and so does person 2\nFirst Passenger Sits in your seat\nFirst Passenger Sits in different seat, so Person 2 sits in First Passenger’s seat.\nFirst Passenger Sits in different seat, so Person 2 sits in your seat.\na\nb\nc\nd\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\nTable 3: 4 Passengers\nAfter writing the possibilities and adding the results in Table 3, we get the results four Yes’s and four No’s. This can be written out as (4/8) or simplified to (1/2). Jinkies! The chance of getting your seat if the first passenger doesn’t remember their assigned seat comes out to be 50% again! I think it is time to solve the case.\nFirst Passenger Sits in their seat, and so does everyone else (Yes)\nFirst Passenger Sits in your seat (No)\nFirst Passenger sits in person 2 seat, person 2 sits in person 3 seat, person 3 sits in First Passenger seat (Yes)\nFirst Passenger sits in person 2 seat, person 2 sits in person 3 seat, person 3 sits in your seat (No)\nFirst Passenger sits in person 2 seat, person 2 sits in First Passenger Seat, person 3 sits in their seat (Yes)\nFirst Passenger sits in person 2 seat, person 2 sits in your seat (No)\nFirst Passenger sits in person 3 seat, person 2 sits in their seat, person 3 sits in First Passenger seat (Yes)\nFirst Passenger sits in person 3 seat, person 2 sits in their seat, person 3 sits in your seat (No)\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\nYes\nConclusion\nAfter walking through the problem and then going through the explanation, we now have the answer to our starting question. The original question was, “If the first person to enter the plane didn’t remember their assigned seat and sat in any random seat, what is the probability that after 99 people get on the plane before you, that your seat will be open”?\nTo solve this question, we went through 3 examples with 2,3, and 4 passengers. And from the pattern that we picked up from these examples, we are confident in saying that even if you are the 100th person to enter the plane, there would be 50% chance you would get your seat! Something important to remember is that this solution only works if each person after the First Passenger will sit in their assigned seat if it is open. Otherwise, every seat is free game and your chance of getting the seat is not 50%.\nNow next time you enter the plane, and you hear that one person doesn’t know their seat number, you can think to yourself, “there is going to be a 50% chance I get my seat”.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "In this blog, we will investigate an experiment done on a lady who thought she could tell whether milk had been put into a cup tea before or after the tea. As we analyze this story, we will be introduced to statistical tools which include hypotheses and p-values.",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\nBackground\nOne of the first fathers of statistics was named Ronald Fisher. He is widely known for his research in statistic methods and design of experiments. In one of his books, he gives a lesson on probability and statistics, which according to some sources, was based on a true event.\nOn a calm, pleasant day at a cafe, an argument broke out between a lady and a waiter. The lady was very upset with her order of tea, which consisted only of milk and tea. Now, little history about tea, during this period it was common practice to pour tea first and then milk. Well, our customer lady was upset because she claimed that the tea that given was made in the wrong order - (milk then tea).\nFisher, the statistician, goes on to explain ideas on how we could test whether this lady’s belief is correct. In his proposed test, he said to offer the lady 8 cups of tea, 4 of them being milk then tea, and the other 4, tea then milk. She would be told that 4 of them were prepared in the “proper” way and that her task was to correctly label them. With all of this in mind, we can dive into the analysis of what is happening.\nAnalysis\nTo start off this experiment, we need set up our hypotheses. In general, a hypothesis is a statement about a possible outcome that is predicted to occur. We start with a null and alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis states what is generally believed/accepted; while the alternative states a possible outcome that differs from the already accepted. So, for this experiment:\n\\[\nH_0 (null):\\text{Lady can not distingish the two different types}\\\\  \nH_a (alternative): \\text{Lady can distingish the two different types}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe next factor we get to decide is at what point are we comfortable with saying, “this Lady can indeed, taste the difference between the two types”. In statistics, we call this alpha. And for this experiment and in common statistic practice, we are going to set alpha equal to 0.05.\n\\[\n\\alpha = 0.05\\\\\n\\]\nNow that we have established our hypotheses and alpha, we can now begin our experiment. To find answers to our experiment, we are going to perform an Exact Binomial Test. This test does well in counting the number of successes compared to the number of failures. In this experiment, we have 8 total cups with 2 groups of different tea preparation styles. For each cup, she has 2 choices, giving her a 50% chance of being correct.\nUsing r-studio, we are going to use the binomial test to find out what the p-values would be based on how many cups she could identify correctly.\nThe following sections tell us what the p-values would be for each test.\n\nTests\n\n\n6 Cups Correct\n\nTo calculate the p-values of getting 6 cups corrects, we are going to do the following:\n\\[\n\\text{P(X} > 6| H_0 = \\text{true)}\\\n\\text{= P(X = 6| p = 0.5)}\n\\]\nThe following graph helps us visualize what that this math looks like. It is done by drawing out a Binomial Distribution and then highlighting the areas we are interested in solving. The equation to this math is:\n\\[\nP(X=x) = \\binom{8}{x}  p^x(1-p)^{8-x}\n\\]\nOur actual value is listed below.\n\n\npp = (plot(0:8, dbinom(0:8, 8, 0.5), type = 'h',\n     lwd = 9,col = c(rep(1,6), \n                     rep(2)), \n     main = \"Binomial Probability\",\n     ylab = \"P(X = x)\", xlab = \"Number of successes\"))\n\n\n\n\nThe p-value for 6 successes is:\nNow, at the beginning of this test, we decided we wanted an alpha of 0.05. Well, 0.1094 > 0.05, which means if the lady was only able to identify 6 of the cups correctly, we would fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning we do not believe she can taste the difference.\n\n7 Cups Correct\n\n\\[\n\\text{P(X} > 7| H_0 = \\text{true)}\\\n\\text{= P(X = 7| p = 0.5)}\n\\]\n\n\nplot(0:8, dbinom(0:8, 8, 0.5), type = 'h',\n     lwd = 9,col = c(rep(1,7), rep(2)),\n     main = \"Binomial Probability\",\n     ylab = \"P(X = x)\", xlab = \"Number of successes\")\n\n\n\n\nThe p-value for 7 Cups Correct is 0.03125, and 0.03125 < 0.05. This means that if she were to successfully identify 7 of the 8 cups correctly, we would have sufficient evidence to suggest that she can indeed taste the difference between Tea Types.\n\n8 Cups Correct\n\n\\[\n\\text{P(X} > 8| H_0 = \\text{true)}\\\n\\text{= P(X = 8| p = 0.5)}\n\\]\n\n\nplot(0:8, dbinom(0:8, 8, 0.5), type = 'h',\n     lwd = 9,col = c(rep(1,8),\n                     rep(2,3)),\n    main = \"Binomial Probability\",\n     ylab = \"P(X = x)\", xlab = \"Number of successes\")\n\n\n\n\nAnd lastly, we have if she were to identify all 8 cups correctly, her value would be 0.003906, which is < 0.05. With this value, we can say we evidence to suggest that the lady can indeed taste the difference between the two types of tea.\n\nAll Options\n\nFor this last graph, I went ahead and gave the p-value that we would get for each given number of successes. It might be worth discussing the p-values for the successes 1 and 0. They both have p-values less than 0.05, but if she were to only get 1 cup correct, we wouldn’t be saying that she is good at identifying types. It is important to think through the problem with the gathered information before making any accusations.\n\n\ndata.frame(heads = 0:8, \n           pmf = dbinom(x = 0:8, size = 8, prob = 0.5)) %>%\nggplot(aes(x = factor(heads), y = pmf, fill = factor(pmf))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = round(pmf, 3), y = pmf + 0.01),\n    position = position_dodge(0.9),\n    size = 3,\n    vjust = 0\n  ) +\n  labs(title = \"Probability of X = x successes.\",\n       x = \"Successes (x)\",\n       y = \"Probability\") +\n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark1\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(\n    hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\", size = 20))\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn today’s blog, we were able to use Probability and Statistics to answers to this ‘real world’ question. Now, most of our questions aren’t going to be based on tea and milk, but Binomial Distributions are being used constantly. Whereever there is a question that broken down into Yes/No, True/False, or Success/Failure, this is the distribution you would want to use.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Are you ready to put your luck to the test to try and win a new car?  As we explore the once great game, \"Let Make A Deal\", back from 1975, you will have the chance to see if you can crack the puzzle and win the prize.",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\nThe Game\nThe American TV show, “Let’s Make A Deal”, started in 1963 and was a global hit. The premise of the game was that a contestant would be offered a prize and then given a choice whether they would like to keep it or exchange it for a different prize. The challenge is that the other prize is hidden from the player. So, in the act of exchanging, the player doesn’t know if they are getting a new prize of better or worse value.\nOn the show, there was a particular game that was played that has since then become famous and has been named the Monty Hall Problem. In this game, the contestant would be shown three doors, behind one of them, a glorious prize, behind the other two, goats. Through a serious of steps, the contestant would try and guess which door has the prize.\nBefore I share some statistical knowledge to them game, lets run through it as if we were contestants. Instead of playing behind three doors, we will play with playing cards that either have a goat or a queen. As in the image below, there are there are two possible outcomes, a goat, or a queen.\n\nFace Down\n\n\n\n\n\nFace Up\n\n\n\nLet’s Play a Round\nWhat would happen first, is Monty (the Host of the game show), would ask you to pick any door. You would then pick any of the three cards. Note, we are not going to flip over this card, instead we will save it till the end. Now, let’s say you pick the left door to save because you think it has the Queen behind it.\n\n\nAfter picking which door to save, Monty would then show you a goat behind one of the other two doors. Since two of the cards have goats on the other side, there will always be at least one card to flip over that has the goat.\n\n\nAt this point, you know that the Queen is either behind the card you chose at the beginning or behind the card still face down. Monty will then ask you, would you like to keep your card, or switch to the other one. Whichever card you pick will be the card you end the game with, resulting in either a grand prize, or a goat.\nIn this example, you decide to test your luck and stay with the card you picked at the beginning. Monty then flips over the cards to show that your card had the other goat. Sadly, you lost the game and didn’t get the prize.\n\n\nThe concept of this game seems quite straightforward - pick a card and hope that you picked right. But there is little more than just luck at play in this game. As this game was played more and more times, statisticians found that this game relied greatly upon the fundamentals of probability.\nIn the next section, I will elaborate on how probability might hold the key to understand this game as well as winning the prize.\nThe Probability Explained\nTo begin, let start off by understanding some simple probability facts. First, all the probabilities in each event must add up to 1. The probabilities of each event may change or moved around but at the end, must always add up to 1.\nNow let’s begin; we know that behind two of the cards there are goats and behind the other is the queen. So, if we were to assign probabilities of being the queen to each card, each would have a 1/3 chance. At this point, trying to guess which card would be the queen would be a gamble.\n\n\nNext, Monty is going to flip over one of the cards to show us a goat. However, we now have an issue with our probabilities, they no longer add up to 1! Does that mean each card now has a fifty-fifty of being the queen?\nWhat happens now is what makes this game so interesting. When we chose that first card, it had a probability of 1/3. This probability will not change, but rather, the probability of another card. To correct our probability issue, we will have to give it a new probability.\n\n\nTo figure this out, lets write out what we know. We know that our card has a 1/3 probability of having the queen. So, to find the probability of the new card, we will subtract 1/3 to 1. This will give us the probability that the ‘Other Card’ is the queen.\n\\[\n\\text{------------------------------------------------}\n\\\\\\text{Prob(Queen| Our Card) = 1/3}\\\\\\text{Prob(Queen| Other Card) = 1 - Prob(Queen| Our Card) = 2/3}\\\\\\text{------------------------------------------------}\n\\]\n\n\nThis means that my switching cards, we go from a 33% chance of having the Queen, to a 66% chance.\nConclusion\nNow wasn’t that fun! From this game, we were able to discover the probability secret to raising our chances of Winning the Prize! To recap what we discovered, when playing this game, when asked if you want to switch your card at the end, SAY YES!\n\n\nfdat <- f_data %>% \n  mutate(running_total_queens = case_when(Door_2 == \"q\"

And then, remember getting to class and finding out that it wasn’t just your birthday, but in fact another persons in your class. Really! Someone else just happens to share the same birthday as you, even with 365 days of the year. Well, in today’s post we are going to uncover the probability of this occurring in any group size.\nExplanation\nThe analysis of this problem will require us to tackle the issue from an opposing view. Instead focusing on the Probability of Sharing the same date, we are going to begin with the Probability of Not Sharing the date. The reason we will want t0 do that is because of the following:\n\\[\n\\text{------------------------------------------------}\n\\\\\\text{Prob(Sharing the Same Birthday) = 1 - Prob(NOT Sharing the Same Birthday)} \\\\\\text{------------------------------------------------}\n\\]\nLet’s tackle this problem with an experiment by creating a classroom that is going to slowing fill up with students. As the first students comes into the room, the probability that he doesn’t share a birthday with any one in the room is 100%. This should make sense because there is no one else in the room, so of course there is a 100% chance.\n\n\n\nThe real trouble will begin as the next student enters the room. Now, we are trying to calculate the chance that the next person WILL NOT have the same birthday; the way to do that will be in two steps.\nFirst, take the birthday of student 1 out from our pool of options. This will leave us with 364 possible ways to NOT share the same day as student 1. (364/365)\nNext, multiply the probability of students 2 NOT sharing a birthday with the other students by the probability that student 1 didn’t share a birthday with anyone when he was the only one if the classroom.\nA mathematical explanation of the previous steps will be offered later\n\\[\n\\frac{365}{365} *\\frac{364}{365} = 99.7\\text%\n\\]\nWhat we learn from the previous step, is that there is 99.7% chance that two people will not share the same birthday.\n\n\n\nFrom this point, the previous steps are applied for as many people are present to calculate the probability of Not Sharing a Birthday. To find the probability of Sharing the same birthday will require one simple addition.\nUsing the classroom example above, let’s say that a third student enters the room. To find out what the probability that two of the three students will share a birthday, the following will be done:\n\\[\n1- \\frac{365}{365} *\\frac{364}{365} *\\frac{363}{365}= 0.80\\text%\n\\]\n\n\n\nConclusion\nAs more students enter the classroom, the probability of sharing a birthday will increase drastically! For many people, the Birthday Paradox seems very illogical - especially when you find out that with 23 people in a room, there is a 50% chance that two people will share the same birthday. But once the pattern and explanation is given, the problem seems to make more sense.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nx_range = seq(1:71)\ninputs = (0:71)\n\nratio =

    "contents": "\n\n\nBackground\nIt is a beautiful afternoon, and you are on your normal walk around the park. After some time of walking, you decide to sit down and catch a breather. While on a bench, you start up a conversation with a very nice lady who says she has come to the park with her two twin children. During the conversation a little boy comes over and calls the lady, “Mom”. As the little boy is talking to his mother, you begin to wonder if the other twin child is also a boy or a girl. After a few moments of thought, you realize that this question has more to do with probability that with biology. What is the probability that the other child is a girl or boy?\nProbability Explained\nMost people know that there is a fifty-fifty chance of getting tails when flipping coin. This can be written out as:\n\\[\n\\text{------------------------------------------------}\n\\\\\\text{Prob(tails) = 1/2} \\\\\\text{------------------------------------------------}\n\\]\nAnd thanks to our knowledge of biology, this same statement applies. The probability of have a boy or girl is 50%. So why then isn’t the answer to the ‘Twin Problem’ just 50% girl and 50% boy? It is because of possible combinations, which we will go over now.\nIf we were to draw out all the combinations of twins, it would look something like the image below.\n\n\nIn total, there are four possible combinations as drawn out in the image. In each combination, there is a specific order that is important to note. We will not use this plot to solve the question.\nAnalysis\nIn the story, you find out that one of the woman’s twins is a boy. This will help us eliminate the possible outcome where both children are girls (image below). The red circle is to demonstrate that we know at least one of the children is a boy for each possible combination.\n\n\nNow, something important to note is that we were not told whether the boy was born first. Because of that, we must keep both combinations 3 and 4 even though they contain the same pieces in their combos.\nThe next step will be to start adding some probability to each option. In the figure below, the remaining combinations are shown with their probability above. In each option, a male is covered with blue, telling us that we already know there is a male twin.\n\n\nAs we see from the illustration above, of the combinations we have left, there is a 1/3 chance of each combination occurring. At this point, we will combine probabilities of those with the same outcome.\n\n\nWith the aid of this last visual, we can see that there is a probability of 33% that the other twin is a boy and a 66% that the other twin is a girl.\nConclusion\nAfter a moment of thinking, you turn to the lady on the bench and ask, “I am just guessing here, but is your other child a girl?” The lady responses with mild surprise, “Yes, have we meet before?” You reply, “no”, and tell her it was just a good guess.\n\n\ngood %>% ggplot(aes(x = Gender, y = Percent, fill = Gender)) + \n  geom_col() +\n  transition_time(Round) +\n  #labs(title = good$Round) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"deepskyblue\", \"purple\")) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = .666, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = .333, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Rounds Played: {frame_time}\",\n       x = \"Gender\",\n       y = \"Other Child Probability\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 28)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
